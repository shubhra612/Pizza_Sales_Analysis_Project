Hey folks,I did this end to end project with the help of MYSQL workbench and POWER BI.First of all you have to import it and  query all the KPIs,after doing this project you will have a great command over MYSQL and POWER BI.I have used cards for KPIs,charts,line chart,funnel chart and DAX formulas.
